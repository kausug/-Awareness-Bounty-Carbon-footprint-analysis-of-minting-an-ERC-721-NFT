This is my project to improve ways to make cripto eco-friendly
It is more feasible to reduce the impact than consumption.

To reduce the impact of energy consumption arising from the cryptographic transaction, there should be a competent measure of responsibility to the marketplaces for each certain amount of pre-established trading, there should be a connection with a competent body responsible for directly planting new areas in places in need of forestry.

Another alternative is to diversify with recycling companies, organic waste, non-organic waste, plastics and other waste discarded by humans.

Cheapening the cost of energy is very important to form a direct impact on measures aimed at cryptocurrencies. Using renewable energy is getting better and better.
